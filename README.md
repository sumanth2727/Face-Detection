FACE DETECTION


The object of our project is to design software that can detect human faces from images. Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualise human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of “object detection technology” that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or
cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot
of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.
In face analysis, face detection helps identify which parts of an image or video should be
focused on to determine age, gender and emotions using facial expressions. In a facial
recognition system -- which maps an individual's facial features mathematically and stores the
data as a faceprint -- face detection data is required for the algorithm that discerns which parts
of an image or video are needed to generate a faceprint. Once identified, the new faceprint can
be compared with stored faceprints to determine if there is a match.


Objective


Whenever we implement a new system it is developed to remove the shortcomings of the
existing system. The computerized mechanism has more edge than the manual system. The
existing system is based on a manual system which takes a lot of time to get performance of the
work. The proposed system is a web application and maintains a centralized repository of all
related information. The system allows one to easily access the software and detect what he
wants.


How face detection works


Face detection applications use algorithms and ML to find human faces within larger images,
which often incorporate other non-face objects such as landscapes, buildings and other human
body parts like feet or hands. Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human
eyes -- one of the easiest features to detect. The algorithm might then attempt to detect
eyebrows, the mouth, nose, nostrils and the iris. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found
a facial region, it applies additional tests to confirm that it has, in fact, detected a face.


Advantages of face detection


As a key element in facial imaging applications, such as facial recognition and face analysis,
face detection creates various advantages for users, including:

● Improved security : Face detection improves surveillance efforts and helps track down
criminals and terrorists. Personal security is also enhanced since there is nothing for
hackers to steal or change, such as passwords.

● Easy to integrate : Face detection and facial recognition technology is easy to integrate,
and most solutions are compatible with the majority of security software.

● Automated identification : In the past, identification was manually performed by a person;
this was inefficient and frequently inaccurate. Face detection allows the identification
process to be automated, thus saving time and increasing accuracy.
